 * ------------------------- */

The Yunaite Core is a large-scale MVC framework
that encourages the use of modern web design. 
This MVC framework implements a templating system
and API setup. This is a very new framework and it is
used by me, Devontrae Walls, in all of my large projects.

If you are going to use the Yunaite Core, and if you find
something that needs adjusting, or an addition, please let me know!
